/* 
The WHERE clause allows you to specify a search condition for the rows returned by a query
Besides the SELECT statement, you can use the WHERE clause in the UPDATE or DELETE statement to specify which rows to update or delete.
the WHERE clause is evaluated after the FROM clause and before the SELECT clause.

or,and,like,between,in,limit

MySQL always evaluates the OR operators after the AND operators. To change the order of evaluation,  use the parentheses
When evaluating an expression that has the AND operator, MySQL stops evaluating the remaining parts of the expression 
whenever it can determine the result. This function is called short-circuit evaluation


expr [NOT] BETWEEN begin_expr AND end_expr;

 All three expressions:  expr,  begin_expr, and  end_expr must have the same data type.
 The BETWEEN operator returns true if the value of the  expr is greater than or equal to (>=) the value of  
 begin_expr and less than or equal to (<= ) the value of the  end_expr, otherwise, it returns zero
 The NOT BETWEEN returns true if the value of  expr is less than (<) the value of the  begin_expr or greater than the value of 
 the value of  end_expr, otherwise, it returns 0.
 If any expression is NULL, the BETWEEN operator returns  NULL .
 
 The IN  operator allows you to determine if a specified value matches any value in a set of values or returned by a subquery.

#triggers:
/* 
In MySQL, a trigger is a stored program invoked automatically in response to an event such as insert, update, or delete that occurs in the associated table. 
For example, you can define a trigger that is invoked automatically before a new row is inserted into a table.

A row-level trigger is activated for each row that is inserted, updated, or deleted.  
For example, if a table has 100 rows inserted, updated, or deleted, the trigger is automatically invoked 100 times for the 100 rows affected.

A statement-level trigger is executed once for each transaction regardless of how many rows are inserted, updated, or deleted.

MySQL supports only row-level triggers. It doesn’t support statement-level triggers.
